Dear Andy,

I spent a bit of time thinking about organization. I now have the paper clear in my brain. 

Here's the proposal for MVP: 

1. Sampling: for both comScore (2012 and 2013 for now) and YouGov, provide appendix tables that compare sociodem to benchmarks in the SI. And then also devise some basic weighting schemes and provide summary of reduction in MSE with pop. benchmarks after weighting. (THIS IS ON YOUR TABLE. DATA FOR COMSCORE DEM IS IN.)

Three specific outputs needed from you:
a. SI tables for both comScore and YG (if you don't know where to get pop. benchmark data, let me know.)
b. For each dataset (YG, ComScore 2012, ComScore 2013), a weight column (add it to sociodem. file for comScore.)
c. For YG, also compare split for PID with ANES data (in the same table). (We will add that to comScore at a later time.)

Timeline: Next Friday?

2. Measuring Pornography: We will provide three ways of measuring porn for YG (Wakoopa, Shalla and ML). For comScore, it would be shalla and ML. (THIS IS ON MY DESK.)
Two outputs from me:
a. In-text Description 
b. yg gets three extra cols. (wakoopa_porn, shalla_porn, ml_porn), comscore gets (shalla_porn, ml_porn)

Timeline: Next Friday.

3. Predict PID (Let us get the pipeline working, optimization of model can come later)
a. Need in-text description + working model. 
b. Even if the model is somewhat shit, save the model, and write out clearly how to predict from it. (We need to preprocess the comScore data in the same way so that features are commensurable.)

Timeline: 

4. Dependent variables:
a. Total time spent on porn
b. Total number of visits

Points to convey:
1. Density plot for everyone for time, visits
2. Points about how concentrated porn viewing is to a few sites --- top 50 porno sites
3. Point about over time trend
4. Current era: Box-plots by PID (R, I, D) and regression tables for comScore and YouGov.
