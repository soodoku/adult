## Holier than Thou? No Partisan Gap in Consumption of Adult Content

Both the parties claim the higher ground when it comes to women--- one's case for morality is steepled in religion, another's in enduring concern for women. Using passively collected browsing data from 1200 respondents, we test whether Republicans consume more pornography than Democrats. 

### Analysis

#### Measuring Porn

1. Measure domain level porn using the model (piedomains) and using default output from YG. 
2. Validation: Look up top 10 porn sites and make sure they are in every list. This is assuming that there is a sharp skew (which is indeed the case)

#### Outcome Variables

1. Primary outcomes: Total time spent on porn sites, Proportion of time spent on porn sites
2. SI: Total number of visits to porn sites, Proportion of visits to porn sites 
3. What kind of porn? Focus on same sex porn.

#### Outputs

1. Distributions
2. When is porn consumed (night or day, weekday/weekend)?
3. Split by party, region/state, etc. and show the density plot. Plus tables --- old + poisson/quantile regression, given skew---though proportions should be reasonably behaved as DVs.
