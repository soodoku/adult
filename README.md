## Holier than Thou? No Partisan Gap in Consumption of Pornography Online

Both the parties claim the higher ground when it comes to women--- one's case for morality is steepled in religion, another's in enduring concern for women. We test whether Republicans consume more pornography than Democrats. Using passively collected domain level web visitation data from 1200 respondents over June, 2022, we find that the consumption of pornography online is very concentrated with a few respondents consuming a lot of pornography and most consuming little. Our data also rules out large partisan differences in consumption of pornography online.

We measure pornographic content on domains using YG provided classifications and [piedomains](https://github.com/themains/piedomains). We find that there are at best small difference between parties on total time spent on porn sites (or the proportion of time spent on pornographic sites).
