\begin{abstract}
\noindent Consumption of pornography has been blamed for a variety of societal ills, including the rise in misogyny, sex crimes, and the coarsening of culture. Using passively collected browsing data from YouGov, we investigate how much pornography Americans consume online. We find that there is a sharp positive skew in the consumption of pornography, with a small number of users consuming lots of pornography and most consuming small amounts. Only about 32 percent of the respondents consumed pornography online during the month long observation period. Of the people who consumed pornography, the median consumer spent about 44 minutes  consuming pornography and 95 percent spent less than 337 minutes. Lastly, we find that, unlike previous research \citep{macinnis2015american, edelman2009markets}, which relied on ecological inference, Democrats consume about as much pornography online as Republicans.

Consumption of pornography is associated with a variety of disturbing attitudes, beliefs, emotions, and behaviors. Consuming pornography is associated with support for violence against women \citep{hald2010pornography, malamuth2012pornography, donnerstein1984pornography}, belief in rape myths \citep{foubert2011pornography}, increased gender role conflict, lesser sexual satisfaction \citep{szymanski2014psychological, stewart2012young}, poorer relationship quality \citep{szymanski2014psychological, szymanski2015male}, and sexually risky behaviors such as engaging in paid sex, and having extramarital sex \citep{wright2012internet}. A lot of popular pornography also contains a healthy dose of violence. An analysis of popular pornography revealed that 88.2\% of the scenes contained physical aggression, and 48.7\% verbal aggression \citep{bridges2010aggression}. For all these reasons, there are serious concerns about consumption of pornography.

In this paper, we investigate how much pornography Americans consume online. Using passive browsing data from YouGov, we find that there is a sharp skew in the consumption of pornography, with a small set of users consuming a large chunk of pornography. About 68 percent of the respondents abstained from consuming pornography online during the month long observation period. Of the people who consumed pornography, the median consumer spent about 44 minutes consuming pornography and the 95th percentile consumer spent 337 minutes. 

We also use the data to shed light on an age-old debate---whether Democrats consume more pornography than Republicans or vice versa. Both parties claim the higher moral ground. And in surveys both parties think consumption of pornography is abhorrent. Unlike previous research, which relied on ecological inference, we find that Democrats consume about as much pornography online as Republicans \citep{macinnis2015american, edelman2009markets}. Adjusting for background attributes like age, gender etc., makes little difference.

\section*{Data}\label{sec:data}
We use data from YouGov to measure the consumption of adult content \citep{data-dataverse}. YouGov maintains a large panel that is recruits using various methods. YouGov uses matched sampling to survey respondents: it first draws a random sample from a large synthetic representative sampling frame, finds respondents that match the sampled individuals from its panel, and invites them to take a survey. For data on how well Yougov is able to approximate a random sample, see \citet{rivers2009}. For our sample, panelists also shared de-identified web browsing data tracked via passive metering software installed voluntarily on their computers. The software, called RealityMine, captures online visits independent of the type of browser or browser-specific privacy settings.

The data are from 1,200 respondents and contains a month of data from June, 2022. In all, we have data on about 6 million visits. For each visit, we have information on the domain (e.g., wikipedia.org), the time of visit, and the time spent on the domain. The respondents visited about 64k unique sites, of which 900 are pornographic sites. 

Our data also includes characteristics of the 1,200 individuals. We have data on demographic characteristics like birth year, state, gender, race, and education level. We also have information on their party identification. Except for 120 respondents  who did not respond or picked not sure/don't know, the rest stated the party they identified with.  Of the 1,080 individuals who report party identification, 82 percent lean either Republican or Democrat. The remaining 18 percent identify as independent. 

\section*{Measuring Pornographic Content}
We code pornographic content at the domain level. Our main analysis depends on the domain classifications that come with YouGov data. We code domains that YouGov categorizes as ``Adult'' as pornographic sites. These include ``Adult'' (e.g., xvideos.com), ``Adult, Business'' (e.g., onlyfans.com), and ``Adult, Entertainment'' (e.g., hentainfox.com). Yougoc classifies certain domains as 'Adult' that do not primarily carry pornographic content, e.g., urbandictionary.com and 4chan.org . Given the skew in the data (See \cref{fig:top25_adult} and \cref{fig:top25_nonadult})\footnote{We use the \texttt{forestplot} \citep{forestplot} and \texttt{tableone} \citep{tableone} packages to tabulate key descriptive figures.}, we manually check the top adult domains to remove such sites. If there is graphic nudity on the landing page or if the site is some form of erotica, we classify the site as a pornographic. 

In \ref{si:alternate_ways}, we leverage the \texttt{piedomains} package to classify which domains are pornographic sites using machine learning \citep{Chintalapati_piedomains_Predict_the_2022}. We leverage the probability estimates to produce a low false negative and low false positive version. The key results remain unchanged. 


\section*{Results}

\subsection*{Consumption of Pornography}
Across all respondents, only a small fraction of the web browsing visits, approximately 84,000 visits or 1.3 percent, are to pornographic sites. And these visits are concentrated among a few people. Only about 32 percent of the respondents consumed pornography online during the sample period. The average consumer of pornography online spent approximately 230 minutes (standard deviation of 576 minutes). 

The consumption of pornography is also highly concentrated among a few sites, with ten most frequented pornography sites receiving more than 12 times the traffic to all other porn sites  (approximately 109 minutes vs. 9 minutes, see \cref{fig:concentration_porn_consumption}). Close to 80 percent of the traffic to pornographic sites is to just one pornographic site. Looking at the characteristics of consumers of pornography, expectedly, consumers of pornography online are younger and are more likely to be male \cref{fig:} %TODO

\subsection*{Partisan Differences in Consumption of Pornography Online}
Our primary dependent variables of interest are: total time spent on pornographic sites and the proportion of time spent on pornographic sites. (In \ref{si:visits}, we show similar analysis for visits. The upshot is that the key conclusions are unaffected.)

Given the skew in the data, we ran a quantile regression, regressing the duration on party. As Figures \ref{fig:quantile_regression_duration} and \ref{fig:quantile_regression_prop_duration} show, there are no significant differences in consumption of pornographic content between the parties. To account for the possibility that this may be a result of confounding demographic differences between the parties, we control for immutable characteristics like age and gender. (\cref{tab:characteristics_split_by_party} shows differences in age, gender, and race by party identification.) We use these variables in our analyses of pornography consumption below. Given how concentrated pornographic consumption is in our data, it is unlikely to make much of a difference and that is indeed what we find --- see Figure \ref{fig:quantile_regression_duration}.

\section*{Discussion}

Consumption of pornography has been attributed to a variety of ills. It is also considered problematic from a religious perspective. For instance, Christian theologians believe that consumption of pornography leads people away from purity and hence should be avoided.\footnote{\url{https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/help-for-pornography-users/effect-of-pornography}}. The Internet has dramatically increased access to pornography. This has led to the concern that pornography consumption has become very widespread and extensive. Our data suggest that pornography consumption online is highly concentrated with very few people consuming a lot of pornography and most people consuming very little or none.

The second contribution of our paper is estimates of partisan differences in consumption of pornography online. Both the parties claim the higher ground when it comes to women---one's case for morality is steeped in religion, the other's in enduring concern for women. Our data suggest that the partisan differences are likely very small.

Our research has three major limitations. The first concern with our data is that we may not have all the Internet visitation data from a user. If the respondent changes their behavior in response to the knowledge that their data is being collected (even if it is de-identified), for e.g., they may modify their behavior on the machine or figure out ways to evade detection, it may bias our results. In fact, we think it is likely that people would be less likely to search for pornography on machines on which they have installed passive monitoring software (though the data are de-identified). If that is so, our estimates are a lower bound of net consumption of pornography. If this bias varies by party, our estimates of partisan differences will also be biased. 

The second concern with our measurement is that we code content at a domain level. This runs the risk of incurring some ecological fallacy. For instance, our classification would code websites like Tumblr as not carrying pornographic content but some of Tumblr content is pornographic. 

The third concern is that our measures are a point in time. We have data from one month in one year---June, 2022. It is possible that people consume less pornography online and instead spend time outside in June when the weather in many parts of the US is more pleasant than in preceding or following months.

	\caption*{\scriptsize \emph{Notes:}
		Table shows splits by party for pornography consumption and for individual characteristics for the 1,200 individuals.
		This table focuses on differences in medians.
		Party identification is based on a 7-point scale. We code 1--3 as ``Democrat'', 4 as ``Independent'', 5--7 as ``Republican''.
		Column (1) shows subgroups for categorical variables.
		Column (2) indicates the count of missing variables, if any.
		Columns (3)--(5) show the medians, the first quartiles, and the third quartiles, for the full sample, Democrats, and Republicans.
		1st and 3rd quartiles in brackets.
		Column (6) and column (7) report the p-values and standardized median differences for Democrats vs Republicans.
		See Panel A of \cref{tab:characteristics_split_by_party} for differences in means.
