               representative cross-sectional data generated by the General
               Social Survey (GSS) between 2000 and 2012 were employed.
               Pornography consumers expressed more positive attitudes toward
               gay individuals' civil liberties, more moral acceptance of
               homosexuality, and more support for same-sex marriage.
               Moderation analyses indicated the importance of consumers' views
               on personal freedom and morality. Associations between
               pornography consumption and positive views on homosexuality were
               strongest when consumers placed a premium on personal freedom
               and adopted a relativistic perspective on morality. Mediation
               analyses indicated that pornography consumption indirectly
               predicted more positive views on homosexuality through a
               nontraditional attitude toward sex. Supplementary analysis of
               nationally representative three-wave GSS panel data confirmed
               the temporal sequencing of these links. Prior pornography
               consumption predicted a more positive subsequent attitude toward
               nontraditional sex, which in turn predicted more positive

               probing pornography?s socializing effects, in general; a need

               calls for replication studies across the social and behavioral
               sciences, the present study replicated and extended an early US
               longitudinal study finding that pornography consumption

               permissive attitudes among liberal, but not conservative,

               associations between pornography use and content congruent

  abstract  = "Recent studies have found that state-level religious and
               political conservatism is positively associated with various
               aggregate indicators of interest in pornography. Such studies
               have been limited, however, in that they either did not include
               data measuring actual consumption patterns and/or did not
               include data on individuals (risking the ecological fallacy).
               This study overcomes both limitations by incorporating
               state-level data with individual-level data and a measure of
               pornography consumption from a large nationally representative
               survey. Hierarchical linear regression analyses show that, in
               the main, state-level religious and political characteristics do
               not predict individual-level pornography consumption, and
               individual-level religiosity and political conservatism predict
               less recent pornography consumption. However, interactions
               between individual-level evangelical identity and state-level
               political conservatism indicate that evangelicals who live in
               more politically conservative states report the highest rates of

  abstract  = "Religious Americans, and conservative Protestants in particular,
               have historically been the most ardent opponents of

               religiously committed and theologically conservative Americans
               are generally less likely to view pornography than others, the
               difference is often not as great or consistent as one might

               Portraits of American Life Study (N = 2,279). Analyses show that
               greater religious service attendance and prayer frequency are
               predictive of American men (not women) affirming that viewing
               pornography is ?always morally wrong? while still viewing it in

              and increasingly so among younger cohorts, a growing literature
              is considering its potential connection to key social and
              cultural institutions. The current study examined the
              relationship between pornography use and one such institution:
              marriage. We drew on three-wave longitudinal data from 2006 to
              2014 General Social Survey panel studies to determine whether
              married Americans' pornography use predicted their likelihood of
              divorce over time and under what social conditions. We employed a
              doubly robust strategy that combines entropy balancing with
              logistic regression models. We found that the probability of
              divorce roughly doubled for married Americans who began
              pornography use between survey waves (N = 2,120; odds ratio =
              2.19), and that this relationship held for both women and men.
              Conversely, discontinuing pornography use between survey waves
              was associated with a lower probability of divorce, but only for
              women. Additional analyses also showed that the association
              between beginning pornography use and the probability of divorce
              was particularly strong among younger Americans, those who were
              less religious, and those who reported greater initial marital
              happiness. We conclude by discussing data limitations,

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Formative experiences in adolescence lay the
              foundation for healthy and pleasurable romantic and sexual
              relationships. Exposure to pornography may affect these
              experiences. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to synthesize evidence published
              in the past decade on the relationship between exposure to
              pornography and sexual behavior (earlier age of first sex [1],
              lifetime multiple partners [>1], group sex, sexual aggression
              including forced sex, paid sex, teenage pregnancy, and history of
              sexually transmitted infection) in adolescents aged between 10
              and 19 years. METHODS: We identified 19 eligible studies by
              searching MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of
              Science databases from January 2010 to November 2022. RESULTS:
              Out of 8 studies that assessed earlier age of first sex, 5
              studies, including 1 longitudinal study, found a statistically
              significant association with exposure to pornography. Given that
              most studies were cross-sectional or had substantial limitations,
              causal inference could not be made. Also, exposure to pornography
              was not measured consistently. The evidence was conflicting or
              insufficient to draw any conclusions regarding other outcomes.
              CONCLUSIONS: More quantitative research is needed to elucidate
              the association between pornography exposure and sexual behavior,
              and sex education should adopt evidence-based approaches to
              minimize the potential harms from pornography. TRIAL

              relatively constant over this 40-year period and, if anything,

              this increase has been smaller than would be inferred based on

  abstract  = "Although both storied and extensive, social scientific research
               on the effects of pornography consumption on males has primarily
               focused on testing the feminist contention that pornography
               contributes to sexual aggression against females. Other parties
               have expressed concern about males' use of pornography, however.
               ``Moralists'' (Linz \& Malamuth, 1993 ) have argued that
               pornography promotes a permissive approach to sexual relations.
               Public health researchers have hypothesized that pornography
               encourages epidemiologically risky sexual behavior. This study
               used cross-sectional General Social Survey data gathered between
               1973 and 2010 to assess these claims for empirical support. In
               line with moralists' contentions, pornography consumption was
               associated with having more positive attitudes toward teenage
               sex, adult premarital sex, and extramarital sex. Pornography
               consumption was also positively related to actually engaging in
               extramarital sex. In line with public health researchers'
               concerns, pornography consumption was associated with having
               more sexual partners and engaging in paid sex behavior.
               Additional longitudinal and experimental research is needed to
               determine the directionality of these associations and to rule
               out possible third-variable confounds, such as erotophilia or
               hypersexuality. Regarding consumption, the percentage of adult
               U.S. males who consume pornography appears to have increased

  author   = "Ybarra, Michele L and Mitchell, Kimberly J",
  abstract = "Estimates suggest that up to 90\% or more youth between 12 and 18
              years have access to the Internet. Concern has been raised that
              this increased accessibility may lead to a rise in pornography
              seeking among children and adolescents, with potentially serious
              ramifications for child and adolescent sexual development. Using
              data from the Youth Internet Safety Survey, a nationally
              representative, cross-sectional telephone survey of 1501 children
              and adolescents (ages 10-17 years), characteristics associated
              with self-reported pornography seeking behavior, both on the
              Internet and using traditional methods (e.g., magazines), are
              identified. Seekers of pornography, both online and offline, are
              significantly more likely to be male, with only 5\% of
              self-identified seekers being female. The vast majority (87\%) of
              youth who report looking for sexual images online are 14 years of
              age or older, when it is developmentally appropriate to be
              sexually curious. Children under the age of 14 who have
              intentionally looked at pornography are more likely to report
              traditional exposures, such as magazines or movies. Concerns
              about a large group of young children exposing themselves to
              pornography on the Internet may be overstated. Those who report
              intentional exposure to pornography, irrespective of source, are
              significantly more likely to cross-sectionally report delinquent
              behavior and substance use in the previous year. Further, online
              seekers versus offline seekers are more likely to report clinical
              features associated with depression and lower levels of emotional
              bonding with their caregiver. Results of the current
              investigation raise important questions for further inquiry.
              Findings from these cross-sectional data provide justification

              that was published in peer-reviewed English-language journals
              between 1995 and 2015 on the prevalence, predictors, and
              implications of adolescents' use of pornography. This research
              showed that adolescents use pornography, but prevalence rates
              varied greatly. Adolescents who used pornography more frequently
              were male, at a more advanced pubertal stage, sensation seekers,
              and had weak or troubled family relations. Pornography use was
              associated with more permissive sexual attitudes and tended to be
              linked with stronger gender-stereotypical sexual beliefs. It also
              seemed to be related to the occurrence of sexual intercourse,
              greater experience with casual sex behavior, and more sexual
              aggression, both in terms of perpetration and victimization. The
              findings of this review need to be seen against the background of
              various methodological and theoretical shortcomings, as well as
              several biases in the literature, which currently precludes

              has been the subject of dozens of studies over multiple decades.
              Nevertheless, scholars have not come to a consensus about whether
              effects are real. The current meta-analysis examined
              experimental, correlational, and population studies of the
              pornography/sexual aggression link dating back from the 1970s to
              the current time. Methodological weaknesses were very common in
              this field of research. Nonetheless, evidence did not suggest
              that nonviolent pornography was associated with sexual
              aggression. Evidence was particularly weak for longitudinal
              studies, suggesting an absence of long-term effects. Violent
              pornography was weakly correlated with sexual aggression,
              although the current evidence was unable to distinguish between a
              selection effect as compared to a socialization effect. Studies
              that employed more best practices tended to provide less evidence
              for relationships whereas studies with citation bias, an
              indication of researcher expectancy effects, tended to have
              higher effect sizes. Population studies suggested that increased
              availability of pornography is associated with reduced sexual
              aggression at the population level. More studies with improved
              practices and preregistration would be welcome.",
